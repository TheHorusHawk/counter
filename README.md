This is a python program.

It counts the amount of clicks to a button by appending a line with the following information: Day of the month, month, day of the week and time of click to a csv file. Created for counting visitors.

The csv file is created on the first use in the same directory the program is running on, or everytime there's no file called "contador.csv" in the same directory. It starts it off with two lines, "Entradas no espaco" and "Dia do mes, mes, dia da semana, hora."

Csv files are pretty useful should you want to work the data in a spreadsheet later. And the program gui, which consists of a single button, is made to so that you can train anyone to use it in minutes.
